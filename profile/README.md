# Genomic Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change (GenARCC)
Using genomic tools, GenARCC aims to inform climate change adaptation, to help protect Canadaâ€™s biodiversity, ecosystem resiliency, food security, and health. The GenARCC team will use their expertise to address the following questions:

1. How are critical species and populations adapted to their environment?
2. Is this relationship changing in response to climate change?
3. How will these critical species and populations respond in the coming years?
